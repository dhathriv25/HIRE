# 💧 Waterfall Software Development Process

The **Waterfall Model** is one of the earliest and most traditional software development methodologies. It follows a **linear and sequential** approach, where the project flows through predefined phases like a waterfall — from requirements to maintenance.

---

## 📋 Phases of the Waterfall Model

### 1. Requirements Gathering and Analysis
- Collect all the requirements from stakeholders.
- Create a **Software Requirements Specification (SRS)** document.
- No development starts until requirements are finalized.

### 2. System Design
- Translate requirements into architectural and design specifications.
- Define data models, interfaces, and system components.
- Output: **Design Document Specification (DDS)**.

### 3. Implementation (or Coding)
- Developers write code based on the design.
- Each module/unit is developed and tested individually.

### 4. Integration and Testing
- Combine all modules and perform comprehensive system testing.
- Types of testing: unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing.
- Fix any bugs or issues found.

### 5. Deployment
- Deliver and install the software in the user environment.
- Provide training if needed.

### 6. Maintenance
- Resolve user-reported issues.
- Apply updates and optimizations as needed.
- Continues for the lifecycle of the software.

## ✅ Advantages of the Waterfall Model

- **Simple and Easy to Use**: Easy to understand and manage, especially for small teams or projects.
- **Structured Approach**: Each phase has clear deliverables and deadlines.
- **Early Documentation**: Helps with future maintenance and regulatory compliance.
- **Better Control**: Clear milestones for monitoring progress.
- **Best for Fixed Requirements**: Ideal when requirements are stable and well-understood from the beginning.

---

## ⚠️ Limitations

- ❌ **Inflexible to Changes**: Hard to go back once a phase is completed.
- ❌ **Late Testing**: Problems may only appear late in the project lifecycle.
- ❌ **Not Ideal for Complex or Evolving Projects**.

## 📌 When to Use Waterfall

- Requirements are clearly defined and unlikely to change.
- The project is short-term and simple.
- Regulatory documentation is required.
- Stakeholders prefer a structured and predictable plan.
